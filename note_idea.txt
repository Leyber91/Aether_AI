Think now how we brought to live this examples,  now we udnerstand it is a good time to set up the wizard, the wiards will be a multilayer pormpt that will unederstand the request and we will analzye the reposne through manya layers, so we take the initial prompt, pass it through phi4 mini, phi4-mini:latest              78fad5d182a7    2.5 GB, how many times we would need to pass the prompt through is like, now maanalsye it, then the outptu is pass through the same mdoel again with the additional rinitial prompt, plus the results of the node and then, we need to show them the tempaltes we jsut developed as examples on how the strucutre work, then that response is passed again t o phi4, alogn with the previous reposnes of the rpevious two steps, and then it will otuput the desired workflow schema, and ocne we have it we will use another modle to clean it up in case that it wasnt clean enough and sue it as output. So we finally have a workable file that we will use to show on the schema. Are we clear?
