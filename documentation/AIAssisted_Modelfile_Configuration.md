# AI-Assisted Modelfile Configuration

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 22, 2025
**Status:** Implemented

## 1. Overview

The AI-Assisted Modelfile Configuration is a premium feature in AetherCreator that leverages AI to help users create optimized Modelfiles for their specific use cases. This feature analyzes user requirements, hardware constraints, and intended model applications to generate tailored parameter sets, system prompts, and templatesâ€”ensuring models perform optimally for their intended tasks.

## 2. Key Capabilities

### 2.1. Task-Specific Optimization

- **Natural Language Requirement Specification:** Users describe their model's intended use case in plain language (e.g., "Create a coding assistant specialized in JavaScript that explains concepts clearly").
- **Model Type Classification:** The system automatically categorizes tasks into specialized domains (coding, creative writing, scientific analysis, etc.) and optimizes parameters accordingly.
- **Use Case Pattern Recognition:** Identifies common patterns in the task description to apply proven optimization strategies from similar successful configurations.

### 2.2. Hardware-Aware Configuration

- **System Profile Selection:** Users specify their hardware capabilities (memory, GPU, CPU) to receive configurations optimized for their specific setup.
- **Resource Allocation Optimization:** Parameters like `num_ctx`, `num_gpu`, and `num_thread` are tailored to the user's hardware for maximum performance without exceeding capabilities.
- **Performance-Efficiency Balance:** The assistant balances model performance against resource consumption based on hardware constraints and specified requirements.

### 2.3. Parameter Optimization

- **Comprehensive Parameter Tuning:** Automatically adjusts all key Modelfile parameters:
  - Context window size (`num_ctx`)
  - GPU layer allocation (`num_gpu`)
  - Thread utilization (`num_thread`)
  - Sampling parameters (`temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, `repeat_penalty`)
  - Mirostat settings (`mirostat`, `mirostat_eta`, `mirostat_tau`)
  - Stop sequences
- **Trade-off Analysis:** Makes intelligent trade-offs between parameters (e.g., reducing `num_ctx` to allow for more GPU layers on memory-constrained systems).

### 2.4. Content Generation

- **System Prompt Engineering:** Creates tailored system prompts that direct the model toward the specific behavior described in the user's task description.
- **Template Customization:** Generates optimized templates for models that support them, ensuring proper formatting of inputs and outputs.
- **Complete Modelfile Generation:** Assembles a complete, ready-to-use Modelfile that can be applied with a single click.

### 2.5. Educational Insights

- **Parameter Explanation:** Provides detailed explanations for why each parameter was chosen, helping users understand the optimization process.
- **Learning Opportunities:** Includes tips and insights about model behavior that educate users about the impact of different configuration choices.

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1. Prompt Engineering

The system uses a series of carefully crafted prompts to guide the AI in generating optimal configurations:

1. **Parameter Optimization Prompt:** Analyzes task description and hardware constraints to determine optimal parameter values.
2. **System Prompt Generation:** Creates a tailored system prompt based on the task description and model type.
3. **Template Engineering:** Designs an appropriate template format for the specific model and use case.
4. **Explanation Generation:** Produces clear explanations for why each parameter was chosen.

### 5.2. Model Selection Logic

- **Base Model:** User-specified Ollama model tag (e.g., "llama3:8b", "phi3:mini").
- **Assistant Model:** Uses cached Ollama models for generating configurations, with preference for models with strong reasoning capabilities.

### 5.3. Hardware Optimization Strategies

- **Memory Constraints:**
  - For 8GB systems: Recommends reduced `num_ctx` and conservative GPU layer allocation.
  - For 16GB systems: Balanced approach with moderate context windows.
  - For 32GB+ systems: Maximizes context window and GPU layers as appropriate.
  
- **GPU Utilization:**
  - No GPU: Sets `num_gpu` to 0, focuses on CPU thread optimization.
  - Consumer GPUs (GTX/RTX): Tailors GPU layer allocation based on VRAM capacity.
  - Professional GPUs: Maximizes GPU utilization with appropriate settings.

- **CPU Optimization:**
  - Adjusts `num_thread` based on CPU core count and type.
  - Balances between parallelism and potential resource contention.
