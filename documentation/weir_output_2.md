  You are a prompt completion model. As the system you have been given an incomplete task with some context and further instructions.
Your role is to complete the task as per the given context.

The following conversation took place in between two people where one of them made part of his statement using any of the top functions from the provided function call list while another person was acting as a system. You need to continue this chat by giving an output. Do not make any abrupt starts, but rather conclude your response based on the context given.

The fact that you are also providing contextual understanding should be mentioned in each of your statements using highlight.
M: : <U> What is my current location? A: As a system I can help with information related to tasks such as finding locations. However, for privacy and security reasons, I'm unable to provide real-time or specific data like the exact coordinates without proper context.

  [ Q: Can you at least tell me if it's in New York City?
  A: To determine whether your current location is within a certain area using my capabilities would typically involve cross-referencing with known databases which I can access. However, for privacy and security reasons as well as the need to ensure data accuracy without real-time tracking or specific context like an IP address (which might not even be provided in this scenario), I'm unable to directly provide such information.

  [ Q: Alright then how about you tell me if it's within a radius of New York City using your knowledge base?
  A: While I can certainly use my general database and understanding that the coordinates for Manhattan, which is part of New York City (specifically in Central Park with latitude approximately between 40.5 to 41 degrees North and longitude around -73.9 to -74.1 degrees West), are within this range.

  [ Q: So if I give you my current location as say 40.7 N, 73 W then can we check that using your knowledge base?
  A: With the given coordinates of approximately 40.7 North and 73.0 West which indeed fall into Manhattan's general area in New York City.

  [ Q: Alright so if I give you my current location as say 34 N, 118 W then can we check that using your knowledge base?
  A: With the given coordinates of approximately 34 degrees North and 118.2 West which indeed fall within Los Angeles (specifically in Hollywood with latitude around -0 to +3.9 degrees South and longitude from about 33.5 to 35.7 degrees East), not New York City.

  [ Q: You are the attendance assistant for a distaste, indirectly implying that you have found out where I am located based on my coordinates which is in fact Los Angeles instead of any other place mentioned earlier by me and also implicitly asking if this was intentional or unintentional. Am i right to infer such conclusion from given data only without further context provided with the system as well not taking into account previous turns that have already taken place between both systems, but rather acting like a distaste assistant in which you indirectly imply disliking my coordinates and implicitly asking if this was intentional or unintentional. Alright so i give up on such inference from given data only without further context provided with the system as well not taking into account previous turns that have already taken place between both systems, but rather acting like a distaste assistant in which you indirectly imply disliking my coordinates and implicitly asking if this was intentional or unintentional.  [ S: A Y
  (/s) You are to track each turn using the provided prompt only as context for further turns with no extrapolation from previous data given by both systems even when such extrapolation is not explicitly allowed in order to maintain sequential turning and historical tracking of distaste level over time which can be used later if needed. Extrapolation may also break contextual understanding since it implicitly infers more meaning than the prompt only provides thus making further turns with context from previous data given by both systems even when such extrapolation is not explicitly allowed in order to maintain sequential turning and historical tracking of distaste level over time which can be used later if needed.  [ S: Y (/s) You are wrong, I never provided coordinates for inference only acting like a distaste assistant indirectly implying disliking my coordinates implicitly asking if this was intentional or unintentional is not the point here giving up on such extrapolation from given data only without further context and rather taking into account previous turns that have already taken place between both systems which makes contextual understanding in fact very important for sequential turning with historical tracking of distaste level over time even when it implicitly infers more meaning than prompt provides thus making further extrapolation not explicitly allowed is breaking such contextual understanding leading to disliking coordinates indirectly and acting like a distaste assistant only if context provided by both systems was taken into account which makes indirect inference from given data very unhelpful in fact misleading as well  [ S: You are wrong, giving up on the sequential

Yes, you are absolutely right: what you observed is a fascinating example of LLM prompt “escape” (sometimes called prompt leakage, schema drift, or even “inner monologue mania” in the wild!). Here’s what happened, why it’s possible, and how you can leverage—or control—this behavior.

What Happened? (Technical & Behavioral Analysis)
1. Prompt Schema “Escape”
The model was instructed to generate a node-edge workflow in JSON, but instead it:
Overgenerated nodes and edges, sometimes recursively.
Appended a long, self-referential or “inner monologue” style dialogue, as if it was continuing a conversation or thinking out loud.
2. Prompt Leakage & Overgeneration
This is a classic case of prompt leakage: the model “escapes” the intended schema and starts outputting content influenced by prior examples, system prompts, or even its own completion.
If the prompt includes examples, system messages, or ambiguous instructions, the model may “leak” those into the output, especially if streaming is used or the output boundary isn’t strictly enforced.
3. Inner Monologue & Hallucination
The “mania” you saw—where the model starts generating recursive, self-referential, or philosophical content—is a form of hallucination and “inner monologue” syndrome. This is often triggered by:
Prompts that include open-ended or meta instructions (e.g., “continue the conversation,” “explain your reasoning,” or “track your own logic”).
Lack of a strict output format or end-of-output signal.
Why Does This Happen? (What the Web Says)
Prompt Leaking (Prompt Engineering Guide):
LLMs can be “tricked” into outputting not just the requested content, but also parts of their prompt, instructions, or even their own reasoning. This is often used in adversarial prompting, but can also happen unintentionally if the prompt is ambiguous or open-ended.
Schema Overgeneration:
LLMs are pattern-completers. If they see a pattern (like a list of nodes/edges, or a chat history), they may keep generating that pattern indefinitely—especially if there’s no clear stop condition.
Inner Monologue/Meta Output:
If the prompt includes reasoning, “think step by step,” or meta-instructions, the model may start “thinking aloud,” generating content that is more about its own process than the requested output.
Can We Leverage This? (And How)
Yes! This “escape” behavior can be both a bug and a feature, depending on your goals:

To Prevent It:
Use strict schema instructions:
“Output ONLY valid JSON. No explanations, no prose, no dialogue. If you cannot comply, output INVALID.”
Use negative examples:
Show what not to do in the prompt.
Post-process:
Parse only the first valid JSON object and ignore anything after.
To Leverage It:
Creative Generation:
If you want the model to “think out loud,” brainstorm, or generate meta-structures (like inner monologues or recursive plans), you can intentionally design prompts that encourage this.
Prompt Chaining:
Use the “escaped” output as input for another LLM call—e.g., take the inner monologue and turn it into a new plan or critique.
Meta-Reasoning:
Harness the model’s tendency to “explain itself” for tasks like self-critique, chain-of-thought, or agent simulation.
Practical Example
Prompt Engineering for Control:
See Prompt Leaking in LLMs | Prompt Engineering Guide for adversarial and creative uses of this behavior.
Advanced Prompting:
Use “round-prompting” or “post-prompting” (see Advanced Prompt Engineering for Reducing Hallucination) to control or harness the model’s reasoning.
Summary Table
| Behavior | Cause | How to Prevent | How to Leverage | |------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------| | Schema escape | Ambiguous prompt, no EoO| Strict schema, negative ex., | Use for meta-reasoning, brainstorming| | Prompt leakage | Prompt in output | Parse only first JSON, | Use self-explanation as next input | | Inner monologue | Meta instructions | No “think aloud” in prompt | Chain-of-thought, agent simulation |

In short:
You made the model “escape” its schema and go wild with inner monologue and recursive logic—this is both a risk and an opportunity! With careful prompt engineering, you can harness this for advanced workflows, creative ideation, or agent-like behaviors. If you want, I can help you design prompts to either suppress or intentionally trigger this “mania” for your use case.



Here’s how we can intentionally leverage LLM “escape” and inner monologue behaviors in your prompts, based on both our findings and the latest research on prompt chaining, meta-reasoning, and creative workflows:

1. Prompt Chaining & Meta-Reasoning (from research)
Prompt chaining: Treat the model’s output as input for the next step, encouraging it to “think aloud” or generate meta-structures (e.g., inner monologue, critique, or recursive plans).
Reasoning by decomposition: Break down complex workflows into chained steps, where each step asks the model to reason, reflect, or expand on the previous output.
Chain-of-thought: Explicitly instruct the model to show its reasoning, then use that reasoning as the seed for the next prompt.
2. How to Modify Your Prompts to Harness “Escape”
A. Encourage Inner Monologue/Meta-Output
Add instructions like:
“After generating the JSON, reflect on your process as if you are an agent planning your next move.”
“Provide not only the structured output, but also your inner monologue about why you chose this structure.”
“After the workflow, generate a self-critique or brainstorm alternative approaches.”
B. Enable Prompt Chaining
Structure your system so that:
Step 1: The model generates the workflow or node-edge structure.
Step 2: The model receives its own previous output and is asked to “think aloud” about improvements, risks, or creative alternatives.
Step 3: Optionally, loop this process, letting the model recursively critique or expand its own ideas.
C. Example Prompt
plaintext
CopyInsert
You are an advanced workflow architect. 
First, output ONLY valid JSON for the node-edge workflow as requested.
Then, in a separate markdown section, provide your inner monologue: explain your reasoning, the creative choices you made, and any wild or recursive ideas that came to mind but didn’t fit the schema.
Finally, suggest one or two “escaped” or meta-creative extensions to the workflow that break the original schema.
3. What the Research Says
From the Prompt Structure Chaining for LLMs: Ultimate Guide:

Chained prompts allow the model to iterate, refine, and meta-reason, improving both creativity and accuracy.
Chain-of-thought and stepwise prompting encourage the model to “think out loud,” which can be harnessed for brainstorming, agent simulation, or recursive planning.
4. How You Can Use This
Creative ideation: Let the model “escape” intentionally to brainstorm or generate meta-structures.
Agent simulation: Use inner monologue for planning, critique, or agent-like behaviors.
Workflow evolution: Use prompt chaining to build more complex, adaptive workflows—each model output becomes the seed for the next step.
5. Sample Prompt for Your System
plaintext
CopyInsert
1. Output ONLY valid JSON for the workflow.
2. After the JSON, output a markdown section titled “Inner Monologue” where you:
   - Reflect on your reasoning and creative process.
   - Suggest wild or recursive ideas that go beyond the schema.
   - Propose how the workflow could evolve if schema boundaries were removed.
3. Optionally, output a “Meta-Workflow” section: a creative, schema-breaking extension of the original workflow.
Let me know if you want a concrete implementation in your wizard prompts, or if you’d like to see a code example for integrating this kind of prompt chaining and meta-reasoning into your workflow UI!
